## Portfolio with SQLAlchemy 

#### Project Overview
Create an interface for a portfolio web application.
The portfolio should contain:
    1. A main index page that lists my projects including the project title and a short description.
    2. Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description
    3. The application should let the user add or edit project information.
    4. The results of these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage
